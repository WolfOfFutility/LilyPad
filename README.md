# Untold
A simple OpenSource key/value store to empower local development of developer projects. All objects are saved to file for re-use in later iterations.

This repository currently only uses base go modules - no third party open source options are used. 

## 1.0 - Queries
The store can be queried with a few basic calls. Each of these calls fall into one of the C.R.U.D. categories and are structured similarly to the examples below.

- PUSH
    - Creates a new row within a store "table" with values provided.
    - Examples:
        - ``` PUSH Username = Admin, Password = admin TO Users ```

- PULL
    - Returns row object(s) based on query parameters.
    - Examples:

- PUT
    - Updates row object(s) based on query parameters.
    - Examples:

- DELETE
    - Removes row object(s) based on query parameters.
    - Examples:

## 2.0 - Encryption
The key/value store is protected by two different types of encryption; Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.

### 2.1 - Symmetric Encryption 
Symmetric Encryption is applied over all .dat files, which is locked by the main.dat key. Keep this key safe, this provides access to usernames, passwords and private keys, which could be used for iterating other secrets.

### 2.2 - Asymmetric Encryption
Asymmetric Encryption (Public Key / Private Key) is used to protect secrets for individual users. A private key is stored in each user profile, which is then used to generate a public key for users as an Auth Token. Whenever a user completes an action, the auth token is validated against another public key generated by the user's private key. Each of the user's secrets are encrypted with the public key, and can only be decrypted with their private key.
